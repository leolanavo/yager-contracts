## About The Project

This is the Yager Contracts' API, a platform for organizing and monitoring contracts.

This is a GraphQL API built with Node and TypeScript using polygloth persistence.
For this persistence we are using TypeORM with postgres for relational data, mongoose
with mongoDB for non-relational data and neo4j for graph data.

For better a understanding of the system, you can check the functional requirements and the modeling of the system that are in the pdf directory.
